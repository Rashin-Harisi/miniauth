This mini-project aims to cover authentication and authorization scenarios using the Express.js backend framework. When a user logs in, a token (JWT) is stored in a cookie (req.cookies). 
This token is then used to verify whether the user has access to protected routes. 
Additionally, user information can be retrieved and displayed using the data stored in the token.
